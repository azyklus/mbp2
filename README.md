# OTHER SKIES BLOG

My Blog/Portfolio app v2:
`mbp2` is my second iteration of my portfolio and blog hosting application.
In this iteration, I use Rust instead of Go and make use of the Rocket server
to handle routing and file serving while handing off the frontend of the app
to TypeScript and the React library.

The Other Skies Blog hosts content in a range of categories from tech and HOW-TOs to politics and
even some science fiction writing on the side if you're lucky!

The blog exists because I wanted an avenue to distribute my writing without a paywall and to give
myself an outlet some of my creative impulses.

A changelog will be published in this repository and in a special place in the blog when it goes live.

If you'd like to support my blog, you may do so by visiting it and reading my work. Any feedback is
appreciated! :)
