# OTHER SKIES BLOG

The Other Skies blog hosts content in a range of categories from tech and HOW-TOs to politics and
even some science fiction writing on the side if you're lucky!

The blog exists because I wanted an avenue to distribute my writing without a paywall and to give
myself an outlet some of my creative impulses.

A changelog will be published in this repository and in a special place in the blog when it goes live.
